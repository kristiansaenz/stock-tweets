  "description": "Using React and whatever other libraries you’d like, create a simple application using the StockTwits API. Use of UI libraries is allowed. Hint: you will need to have separate backend to handle CORS. ● Allow the user to input a US stock symbol or several symbols (eg: AAPL, BABA, BAC, etc...) ● Pull tweets from Twitter that mention this symbol (stock symbols usually have a $ before them, like: $AAPL, $BABA, etc...) ● Display the latest matching tweets. How you display them is up to you. ● When a new tweet comes in, it should automatically be added without having to refresh the page. ● The user should be able to later add/remove symbols as well. If a user deletes a symbol, the matching tweets should also disappear. ● The page has to be responsive. ● The number of tweets for a given symbol needs to be represented. ● Pay attention to details and make the user-interface and user-experience the best you possibly can, considering time constraints. Code for this assignment needs to be hosted on GitHub and a working version must be accessible via web.",
