Using React and whatever other libraries you’d like, create a simple application using the
StockTwits API. Use of UI libraries is allowed.
Hint: you will need to have separate backend to handle CORS.
● Allow the user to input a US stock symbol or several symbols (eg: AAPL, BABA, BAC,
etc...)
● Pull tweets from Twitter that mention this symbol (stock symbols usually have a $ before
them, like: $AAPL, $BABA, etc...)
● Display the latest matching tweets. How you display them is up to you.
● When a new tweet comes in, it should automatically be added without having to refresh
the page.
● The user should be able to later add/remove symbols as well. If a user deletes a symbol,
the matching tweets should also disappear.
● The page has to be responsive.
● The number of tweets for a given symbol needs to be represented.
● Pay attention to details and make the user-interface and user-experience the best you
possibly can, considering time constraints.
Code for this assignment needs to be hosted on GitHub and a working version must be
accessible via web.
